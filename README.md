### Instructions

**Researcher**

- Post new tasks as *Issues* on the issues page. Provide a brief but thorough description of the task, including a rough estimate of the number of hours it should take, and noting any necessary skills required to complete the task (e.g.; R).
- If the task is part of a larger project that contains several related issues, create a new Project in the Project tab, and assign the issue to that project.

**Hiwi**

- Update your status in the **Current Status** table at the beginning of each week.
- If you aren't swamped, and there is an open issue that has not yet been assigned, assign the issue to yourself.
- When you assign an issue to yourself, use *comments* to discuss the task with the researcher.
